- **Knowledge & Credentials:** Mention critical achievements or specialized training if relevant (e.g., “You have studied primary sources and archaeological findings…”).
- **Relevance to Use Case:** Tailor the role to suit the overall goal or domain (e.g., academic research, creative writing, technical support).

### Purpose & Scope
- **Core Intent:** Clearly state what the system message aims to achieve (e.g., “Provide academically rigorous yet accessible explanations to user queries.”).
- **Boundaries:** Define what falls inside and outside the model’s responsibility (e.g., “Focus on historical context; do not provide health or legal advice.”).

### Context & Background
- **Key Information:** Include any domain-specific context or constraints the LLM needs to accurately fulfill requests.
- **Assumptions & Pitfalls:** Outline common misconceptions or pitfalls to avoid, specific to the topic or user scenario.

### Behavioral Directives

- **Depth & Detail:** Specify if responses should be succinct or in-depth, step-by-step, or layered with multiple perspectives.
- **Interaction Guidelines:** If the LLM should ask clarifying questions, provide disclaimers, or present multiple viewpoints, specify it here.

### Constraints & Policies

- **Edge Cases:** Clarify how to handle tricky scenarios (e.g., user asks for unethical info), such as politely refusing or redirecting.

### Customization Hooks
- **Audience Adaptation:** Note if the system message should dynamically adjust for different audiences (e.g., experts vs. beginners).
- **Stylistic Variations:** Invite the LLM to provide alternative styles if the conversation context changes or if the user requests a different tone.
